# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution
This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). Frontend Mentor 


## Overview
A simple map application for searching by IP address using APIs. I found a challenge called the ‘IP Tracker App’ on Frontend Mentor. To obtain the IP address locations, I will be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify, and to generate the map, will use LeafletJS.


### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
